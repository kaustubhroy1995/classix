# Precompiled Wheels

This folder contains precompiled wheel files for Windows, generated by the
`build_windows_wheels` GitHub Actions workflow.

## Installation

Install a wheel matching your Python version directly:

```bash
pip install precompiled_wheels/classixclustering-<version>-cp<pyver>-cp<pyver>-win_amd64.whl
```

No C/C++ compiler is required — the Cython extensions are already compiled.

## Regenerating Wheels

Wheels are rebuilt automatically by the **Build Windows Wheels** workflow.
You can trigger it manually from the GitHub Actions tab or on every push to
the `main` or `master` branch.
