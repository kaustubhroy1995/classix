# Generated Wheels

This directory stores pre-built Windows wheel files generated by the `build_windows_wheels.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.

## How it works

The workflow:
1. Builds wheels on Windows for Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13
2. Tests each wheel installs properly **without** any C or Cython compilation
3. Verifies the Cython extensions are bundled and functional
4. Uploads the wheels as downloadable artifacts

## Downloading wheels

Go to the **Actions** tab → select a successful **Build Windows Wheels** run → download the `generated_wheels` artifact.

## Installing from a wheel

```bash
pip install classixclustering-<version>-cp<pyver>-cp<pyver>-win_amd64.whl
```

No C compiler or Cython is required when installing from a wheel.
